# Supermarket Billing System
## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a C++ code implementation for a supermarket billing system. The program offers a menu-driven command-line interface where users can seamlessly add items to their bill, view comprehensive bill details, and securely exit the program.

## 🚀 Key Features
Product Information Storage: Utilizes C++ structures to define and store product catalogs, including unique product codes, names, and prices.

Dynamic Bill Management: Tracks running subtotals and purchased item quantities using arrays to calculate final costs accurately.

Interactive Menu: Provides a command-line interface loop with continuous options to "Add Item", "Display Bill", and "Exit".

Robust Error Handling: Includes validation to handle invalid menu choices and unrecognized product codes, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted operation and a user-friendly experience.

## 💻 Technical Implementation
This system serves as a foundational framework, demonstrating the practical application of fundamental C++ concepts:

Implementation of custom struct data types.

Array manipulation for inventory and purchase tracking.

Logic control using while loops and switch statements.

User input handling and command-line data processing.
